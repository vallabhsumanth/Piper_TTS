# Piper_TTS
Piper is a fast, lightweight, and high-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis system built for modern CPU/GPU-based inference. It's developed by rhasspy/piper and designed to generate realistic speech from text using pre-trained voice models. Piper is especially suitable for edge devices, real-time applications, and embedded systems.

1) High-quality voice synthesis using VITS (Variational Inference Text-to-Speech) architecture.

2) Real-time performance on modern CPUs and GPUs.

3) Compact voice models optimized for various languages and accents.

4) Simple CLI and API interface for easy integration.

5) Supports phoneme-based synthesis for improved pronunciation accuracy.

6) Voice models in .onnx format (ONNX Runtime backend)
